MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm) represents state-of-the-art optimization over multiple conflicting design goals. Instead of a priori deciding on what to prioritize, multi-goal optimization enables to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions which can then be explored to select one or more solutions which most suitably perform for your specific application.

Furthermore, MOGA is a gradient-free method - which means it can operate over any model, independently of whether gradient information is available. When coupled with Surrogate Models, which represent a paradigm shift in simulation analysis by creating simplified mathematical models that approximate complex system behavior, it is possible to perform extensive parameter space exploration in mere seconds.
